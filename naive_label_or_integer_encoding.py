Brief about Label or Integer Encoding:
In the field of NLP, generally, AI/ ML Algorithms donâ€™t work on text data. We have to find some way to represent text data into numerical data.
Any data consists of reverse_vocab_word_index. So in case, we find some way to convert (Encode) reverse_vocab_word_index into numerical data, then our whole data could be converted into numerical data, which can be consumed by AI/ ML algorithms.
Label/ Integer Encoding of Words is one of the initial methodologies used to encode the reverse_vocab_word_index into numerical data. In this methodology, we assign a numerical value to every word in the corpus starting with zero.
About Code: This code demonstrates the  Label or Integer Encoding with two simple example corpus
